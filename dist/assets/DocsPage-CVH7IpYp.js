It runs unlimited independent trading bots against 83 pre-built strategies across US equities and crypto markets.

Key concepts:
• Bots — Isolated agents. Each has its own IBKR clientId, capital allocation, and strategy assignments.
• Strategies — Codified entry/exit rules. You choose which strategies a bot runs.
• Kill Switch — Master override that stops all trading instantly (POST /api/control/kill).
• Paper Trading — All strategies can run in paper (simulated) mode before going live.
• Signal Validation — Every signal is logged with a UUID, confidence score, and backtest stats.`},{title:"Create Your Account",content:I},{title:"Connect Interactive Brokers (IBKR)",content:`IBKR is the primary broker for equity trading.

Max Drawdown:
Largest % decline from a strategy's equity peak to its subsequent trough. Anything above 30% warrants careful review before live deployment.

Profit Factor:
Gross Profit / Gross Loss. >1.5 is healthy; >2.0 is strong. Below 1.0 means the strategy loses money on aggregate.

95% 1-day VaR of $1,000 means: "On 95 out of 100 trading days, I expect to lose no more than $1,000."

Conditional VaR (CVaR) answers: "On the bad days that exceed VaR, how much do I actually lose on average?"
CVaR is always worse than VaR. If VaR=$1,000 at 95%, CVaR might be $2,500.

How Aura Alpha calculates VaR:
• 252 trading days of historical returns per position
• Historical simulation method (5th percentile of ranked daily returns)
• Aggregated across all positions using correlation matrix (correlated positions aren't fully diversifying)
• Recalculated every 5 minutes during market hours

2. Separate capital allocations — Each bot has its own max allocation percentage.
3. No cross-bot position sharing — A position opened by Alpha cannot be closed by Beta.

  POST /api/watchlists/{id}/symbols
  Body: {"symbol": "AAPL"}`},{q:"How often do strategies get scored by the ML model?",a:`The ML model retrains every Sunday at 2 AM UTC.

The pipeline collects signal/outcome pairs from the trailing 90 days, trains a gradient-boosted model, and outputs new confidence weights. Bots pick up new scores within 60 seconds.

The edge decay report also runs every Sunday at 11 PM UTC to flag strategies whose rolling hit rate dropped >10% below their backtest baseline.

Manual retrain (admin only): POST /api/ml-ops/retrain`},{q:"Can I use Aura Alpha on mobile?",a:`Yes. The iOS app is available on TestFlight (beta). Built with Capacitor 8. Features:
• Live position monitoring
• Kill switch with confirmation
• Bot status and heartbeats
• Signal feed
• Alert management
• Push notifications via ntfy

To join TestFlight, email support@auraalpha.cc with your Apple ID email. Android is in development.`},{q:"What is the founding spot discount?",a:`The founding spot discount is a permanent 25% off any paid subscription, available to early users on a limited basis. Check the pricing page for remaining spots.

Use code FOUNDER25 at checkout to lock in the permanent discount at any tier.

LAUNCH50 is a separate 50% off your first month only (not permanent).`},{q:"What happens when I hit the kill switch?",a:`1. All new signal generation halts within 100ms (Redis pub/sub propagation).
2. All bots stop submitting new orders.
3. Open positions are NOT automatically closed (intentional — rushed exits cause worse fills).
4. Kill switch indicator turns red in the top nav bar.

To reset: Control Plane > Reset Kill Switch.`},{q:"What is signal confidence?",a:`A composite 0–1 score:
• 40% — ML model probability (trained on historical signal/outcome pairs)
• 30% — Backtest Sharpe ratio of the strategy in the current regime
• 20% — Rolling 30-day live hit rate (if available)
• 10% — Volume/liquidity quality of the symbol at time of signal

Bots require a minimum of 0.50. This threshold is configurable per-bot.`},{q:"Can I run strategies on international markets?",a:`Yes, depending on your subscription:
• Explorer / Trader: US only
• Starter: US + 3 regions
• Active: US + 7 regions
• Pro / Elite: All 14 regions

Regions: US, UK (LSE), Germany (Xetra), Japan (TSE), Hong Kong (HKEX), Canada (TSX), India (BSE), and 7 more.

Note: International markets require separate IBKR market data subscriptions.`},{q:"How do I backtest a strategy?",a:`1. Go to Backtest Dashboard.
2. Select a strategy, set the date range, and choose a universe.
3. Click Run Backtest.
4. Review: win rate (>45%), profit factor (>1.5), max drawdown (<20%), Sharpe (>1.0), trade count (>30).
5. If results look solid, click Promote to Paper.`},{q:"What is paper trading and is it realistic?",a:`Paper trading simulates trades with real-time prices but no real orders.

Realistic:
• Signal generation is identical to live mode
• Entry/exit prices use actual bid/ask mid-price at time of signal

Less realistic:
• Fills are instantaneous; real fills may queue
• No market impact (your real orders move the price; paper orders don't)
• Slippage is estimated at 0.05% per trade

For large positions (>$50K/trade), paper results are likely more optimistic than live.`},{q:"What ports does Aura Alpha use?",a:`Control Plane API: 8020 (FastAPI, all /api/ endpoints)
Frontend:          8181 (Vite dev server or nginx in production)
IBKR Gateway:      4001 (IB Gateway TWS socket)
Redis:             6379 (rate limiting + kill switch, optional)
PostgreSQL:        5432 (internal only)

In production (EC2), nginx serves the frontend on port 443 (HTTPS) and proxies /api/ to localhost:8020.`},{q:"How do I restart a crashed bot?",a:`Bots are systemd services:

  systemctl status aura-bot@alpha
  systemctl restart aura-bot@alpha
  journalctl -u aura-bot@alpha -f --since "1 hour ago"

The autorepair cron (ops/ec2_autorepair.sh) runs every 2 minutes and automatically restarts bots that stop unexpectedly.`},{q:"Is there a desktop app?",a:`Yes. The Aura Alpha Desktop app (Electron, v1.5.0) provides:
• Native OS notifications (macOS, Windows)
• System tray integration
• Lower memory usage than a browser tab
• Same-machine IBKR Gateway integration (no proxy needed)
• Bundled Python for local backtest computation

Download at auraalpha.cc/download. Current version: 1.5.0.`},{q:"What is the Portfolio Brain?",a:`The Portfolio Brain is a cross-bot monitoring system that:
• Tracks combined positions across Alpha, Beta, and Crypto bots
• Detects conflicts (e.g., Alpha long XYZ while Beta short XYZ)
• Analyzes total exposure by sector, geography, and asset class
• Suggests allocation adjustments

Important: the Portfolio Brain is READ-ONLY and SUGGEST-ONLY. It never automatically rebalances or closes positions. You must act on suggestions manually.

View: GET /api/portfolio-brain/snapshot`},{q:"What is the Ensemble Score?",a:`The ensemble scorer combines signals from multiple strategies pointing to the same symbol at the same time.

If 3 different strategies all signal "buy AAPL" within a 30-minute window, the ensemble score for AAPL is higher than any single strategy's score.

High ensemble scores often indicate stronger setups because multiple independent rules agree.

View ensemble scores: GET /api/ensemble/scores (also visible in Scanner pages — sortable column).`},{q:"What is cautious mode?",a:`Cautious mode is a system-wide risk throttle that activates when:
• VIX > 30, OR
• 14-day realized volatility of SPY > 25%, OR
• Portfolio drawdown from peak > 15%

In cautious mode:
• Position sizes halved (0.5× Kelly multiplier)
• Strategies with Sharpe <1.0 are paused
• Top 10 highest-confidence signals per bot only
• Crypto bot exposure cap: 95% → 60%

Force cautious: POST /api/control/regime {"mode": "cautious"}`},{q:"Is my trading data sent to Aura Alpha's servers?",a:`Your IBKR credentials are NEVER sent to Aura Alpha's servers — they're entered directly into IB Gateway which runs locally.

Aura Alpha's servers receive:
• Aggregated position data (symbol, quantity, average cost, current value)
• Signal logs and backtest results
• Account equity snapshots (for risk calculations) — no account number or identifying info
